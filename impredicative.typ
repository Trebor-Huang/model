= 非直谓宇宙 <appendix:impredicative>

- Basic rules
- General theory of impredicative universes
  - Proposition as elements of `Prop`, compare with HoTT
  - Choice and Diaconescu's theorem (Appendix?)
- The universe structure of CoC, CIC and pCIC
- Girard's paradox
- Inductive types, large elimination
  - Berardi's paradox

Figure out where to put these:
- Proof irrelevant model of Prop using ZFC sets
  - Tricky a priori, if $"Prop" : "Set"$ ($V_1$ is not small)
  - Easy in Coquand hierarchies, mark variables by sort, but cumulativity won't hold, i.e. $(Pi_"Prop" A B)' != Pi_"Set" A' B'$
  - Easy if Prop is not a universe, Pi and Forall separated
